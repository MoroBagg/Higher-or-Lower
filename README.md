# Higher-or-Lower
This is a game I made in python, it's not complex per se but it's fun nevertheless. Let me know if any issues are found.

This is a game in python in which you can either be guessing or have the enemy player (the program) guessing. I took inspiration of this from a game I played a while back (can't remember the name though) and brought it to life. 

This is not my original idea, the idea was taken from a game. But all the code belongs to me, you may use this code however you want. You can even repost it as long as you give credit to me. Thank you and enjoy this game (in progress).
